                <p>Puerto Rico (Spanish for 'rich port'; abbreviated PR; Taino: Borikén or Borinquen), officially the
                    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. 'Free Associated
                    State of Puerto Rico'), is a Caribbean island, Commonwealth, and unincorporated territory of the
                    United
                    States. It is located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast
                    of
                    Miami, Florida, between the Dominican Republic and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and includes the
                    eponymous
                    main island and several smaller islands, such as Mona, Culebra, and Vieques. With roughly 3.2
                    million
                    residents, it is divided into 78 municipalities, of which the most populous is the capital
                    municipality
                    of San Juan. Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government,
                    though Spanish predominates.</p>

                <p>Puerto Rico was settled by a succession of peoples beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago; these included
                    the Ortoiroid, Saladoid, and Taíno. It was then colonized by Spain following the arrival of
                    Christopher
                    Columbus in 1493. Puerto Rico was contested by other European powers, but remained a Spanish
                    possession
                    for the next four centuries. An influx of African slaves and settlers primarily from the Canary
                    Islands
                    and Andalusia vastly changed the cultural and demographic landscape of the island. Within the
                    Spanish
                    Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru
                    and
                    New Spain. By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered
                    around a
                    fusion of indigenous, African, and European elements. In 1898, following the Spanish–American War,
                    Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States.</p>

                <p>Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917, and can move freely between the island and the
                    mainland. However, when resident in the unincorporated territory of Puerto Rico, Puerto Ricans are
                    disenfranchised at the national level, do not vote for the president or vice president, and
                    generally do
                    not pay federal income tax. In common with four other territories, Puerto Rico sends a nonvoting
                    representative to the U.S. Congress, called a Resident Commissioner, and participates in
                    presidential
                    primaries; as it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in Congress, which governs it
                    under
                    the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. Congress approved a local constitution in 1952,
                    allowing
                    U.S. citizens residing on the island to elect a governor. Puerto Rico's current and future political
                    status has consistently been a matter of significant debate.</p>

                <p>Beginning in the mid-20th century, the U.S. government, together with the Puerto Rico Industrial
                    Development Company, launched a series of economic projects to develop Puerto Rico into an
                    industrial
                    high-income economy. It is classified by the International Monetary Fund as a developed jurisdiction
                    with an advanced, high-income economy; it ranks 40th on the Human Development Index. The major
                    sectors
                    of Puerto Rico's economy are manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and
                    electronics)
                    followed by services (namely tourism and hospitality).</p>

            <p>Act 22 of 2012 —also known as the Act to Promote the Relocation of Investors to Puerto Rico (Spanish: Ley
                para Incentivar el Traslado de Inversionistas a Puerto Rico)— is an act enacted by the 16th Legislative
                Assembly of Puerto Rico that exempts local taxes on certain passive income generated by individuals that
                reside in Puerto Rico.

                To ignite the interest of these new investors, Act 22 provides an exemption from Puerto Rico income
                taxes on
                certain types of passive income attained or accrued after the individual establishes residency.

                As of March 2013 only about a dozen individuals have taken advantage of the act, although many others
                have
                expressed their interest after the media reported that billionaire John Paulson was considering to
                relocate
                to Puerto Rico. The report was later denied by Paulson but media coverage increased inquiries to
                local accountancy firms by 400% after the story broke.

                Act 22 is one of a set of economic incentives that the Government of Puerto Rico has developed for the
                development of the Island's economy. Additional incentives offer unique benefits to investors for
                sectors
                like manufacturing, hospitality and tourism, international insurance and banking, export services, and
                agriculture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The act has come under criticism. In early 2021, in the aftermath of the victory for statehood in the
                2020
                statehood referendum, Act 22 emerged as a stumbling-block to Puerto Rico statehood. Senate Majority
                leader
                Chuck Schumer declared opposition to a pro-statehood bill and criticized Act 22.

                Some claim the act was enacted to promote the displacement of Native Puerto Rican Citizens from the
                island in hope of exhibiting further colonialist control over Puerto Rico. Skeptics include Jeffrey
                Farrow, a former White House official from the Clinton administration, and John Buckley, a former tax
                counsel for the Democratic Party on the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, who have
                described
                the act as a way to make Puerto Rico a tax haven. Congressmen Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Max Baucus
                (D-Montana), Chairman of the United States Senate Finance Committee, have also expressed their opinion
                on
                the matter. Others, however, such as José Pérez Riera and Alberto Bacó Bagué, both former Secretary of
                Economic Development and Commerce of Puerto Rico, and current Secretary Manuel A. Laboy Rivera, see the
                act favorably and describe it as being a way for Puerto Rico to overcome its economic struggles and its
                six
                years long recession.</p>
