        <h1>Claypot Rice</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Claypot Rice (or bo zai fan in Cantonese) is a humble rich dish with an incredibly deep and complex
                flavor
                profile. We can trace the modern claypot rice dish to ancient China where people used claypots over
                fire,
                traditionally charcoal to cook rice. By using a claypot, we can infuse the rice with rich flavors,
                unlike
                in modern rice cookers because rice in a claypot can "breathe" through pores in the clay. In Hong Kong,
                street vendor chefs prepare a classic claypot rice steaming scallions, ginger, Gailan, marinated
                chicken,
                marinated mushrooms, and Chinese Sausage while simultaneously cooking the rice below. In doing so, the
                flavor from the toppings slowly seep into the rice to develop a gently season bed of fluffy white rice.
                The
                most iconic component of the dish and the most technically challenging part of the dish sits at the
                bottom
                of the bowl: the charred rice. Chefs must carefully rotate the bowl to char the rice at the bottom of
                the
                claypot so that a crispy layer can form. The timing must be perfect. If the rice is not charred enough,
                the
                iconic crunchy rice will not form. But if the rice is charred too long, the rice will burn and taint the
                smell of the dish.</p>
            <p>For this recipe, I will cover the core elements of a classic claypot rice and provide guidance as to how
                you
                can mimic the flavors of Hong Kong with limited equipment!</p>

        <h2>Notes Before Starting</h2>
        <p>I would suggest getting a <a src="https://www.amazon.com/Veemoon-Stockpots-Traditional-Convenient-Multi-functional/dp/B0BW9VSQ6N/ref=asc_df_B0BW9VSQ6N/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=673728384183&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13294040171923643550&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9022865&hvtargid=pla-2204545234703&psc=1&mcid=ef5b7ec2c5dd3f0e9d72e0d96d2e2a92">claypot</a>
            especially if you have a gas stove. You can also find other claypots that work on induction stoves. If you
            don't have a claypot and don't wish to buy one, you can use a small (~2 Qt) nonstick pot with a lid.</p>

                    including an interactive ingredient list and embedded media, that help a user gather real time

                    irrating during the cooking process. I also find that the "Review" section on the recipe page
                    validates the content and provides a sense of community that may comfort a user.</p>

                    beautiful products. I wish to adopt their method of thinking to avoid overwhelming a user looking at
