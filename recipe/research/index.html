        <h1>Claypot Rice</h1>
        <p>Claypot Rice (or bo zai fan in Cantonese) is a rice dish with a humble appearance and an incredibly deep and
            complex flavor profile. We can trace the modern claypot rice dish to ancient China where people used clay pots
            over fire, traditionally charcoal to cook rice. By using a clay pot, we can infuse the rice with richer flavors,
            simply because the rice can "breathe", that are typically lost in modern rice cookers when making rice. In Hong
            Kong, street vendor chefs top a classic clay pot rice dish with scallions, ginger, Gailan, marinated chicken,
            marinated mushrooms, and Chinese Sausage while cooking the rice beneath. In doing so, the flavor from the
            toppings slowly seep into the rice to develop a gently season bed of fluffy white rice. The most iconic
            component of the dish and the most technically challenging part of the dish sits at the bottom of the bowl: the
            charred rice. Chefs must carefully rotate the bowl to char the rice at the bottom of the claypot so that a
            crispy layer can form. The timing must be perfect. If the rice is not charred enough, the iconic crunchy rice
            will not form. But if the rice is charred too long, the rice will burn and taint the smell of the dish.</p>
